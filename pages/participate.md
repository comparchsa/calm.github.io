CALM is currently running a pilot program that pairs around 30 mentees. We have
collected applications from potential mentees and are looking for mentors who
are interested in supporting junior architects. We welcome mentors from
different backgrounds, including faculties, industry researchers, and senior PhD
students.

<!-- We will continue to run a year-long program after this pilot program. We will
start collecting applications for the upcoming year-long program soon. Please
