CLAM is currently running a pilot program that pairs around 30 mentees. We have collected applications from potential mentees and are looking for mentors who are interested in supporting junior architects. Mentors include not only faculties and industry researchers, but also senior PhD students. 

If you would like to be a mentor, please fill out this form: https://forms.gle/hFE1qjvAukd8Jv4x6

We will continue to run a year-long program after this pilot program. We will start collecting applications for the upcoming year-long program soon. Please watch out for our announcements at CASA Twitter (https://twitter.com/comparchsa) and CASA Slack (to join: https://www.sigarch.org/casa/#join).
