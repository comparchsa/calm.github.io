# Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring

The Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM) committee within
[CASA](http://www.comparchsa.org) is starting a global initiative to
pair mentors with mentees in the greater computer architecture
community for long-term, e.g.  1 year, mentoring relationships.

Research shows that mentoring is important to the career development of
individuals and the health of a research community, but it also indicates that
mentoring relationships take time to develop.
In the CALM program, Mentors and mentees will meet over the course of the year
to get to know and learn from each other.

To improve mentor-mentee matching and to help focus mentoring discussions,
mentor-mentee pairings will be sorted into two tracks: research and development.
The research track is designed to match mentees without academic advisors with
members of the community to discuss technical topics and provide a window into
research in computer architecture.
The development track is intended for discussions that center on career or
personal development, ranging from job hunting to advice on
navigating the research community as a member of an underrepresented group.

If you are interested in participating as a mentor or mentee please
complete the interest forms below and we will get back to you as soon as we can.
Please note, at this phase we are gauging interest from the community, we are
not matching mentors and mentees just yet.  Our hope is to match a small initial
cohort of mentees by the beginning of 2022 before scaling up the program.

We are currently seeking CALM Committee members to help with the day-to-day
tasks of running a successful long-term mentoring program.  If you can commit
1-2 hours a week to a position that involves communicating with a wide swath of
members of the computer architecture community, please contact the chairs.


<!-- # CALM Advisory Committee

CALM relies on a network of senior researchers who know the people of the
computer architecture community and can provide sage advice on mentor-mentee
pairings.  If you, or a social colleague you know, would be available to respond
to emails several times a month to help match mentors and mentees, please
contact the chairs. -->


# Acknowledgeâ€‹ments

Special thanks to Talia Ringer and the folks at SIGPLAN-M for sharing their
experience establishing a long-term mentoring program.
