Alexandros (Alex) Daglis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science
at Georgia Tech. His research interests lie in the intersection of
computer architecture and systems, with a particular focus on
datacenters, rack-scale architectures, and network-compute
co-design. Being passionate about student mentoring, Alex co-organized
the Rising Stars in Computer Architecture (RISC-A) workshop in 2019
and the Young Architect (YArch) workshop in 2020 and 2021.

**Lena Olson**  
Software Engineer, Google


**Muhammad Shahbaz**  
Assistant Professor, Purdue University

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/shahbaz.jpg" alt="Muhammad Shahbaz's Potrait"/> 
Muhammad Shahbaz is a Kevin C. and Suzanne L. Kahn New Frontiers
Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Purdue University. His
research focuses on the design and development of domain-specific
abstractions, compilers, and architectures for emerging workloads
(including machine learning and self-driving networks). Shahbaz
received his Ph.D. and M.A. in Computer Science from Princeton
University and B.E. in Computer Engineering from the National
University of Sciences and Technology (NUST). Before joining Purdue,
Shahbaz worked as a postdoc at Stanford University and a Research
Assistant at Georgia Tech and the University of Cambridge. Shahbaz has
built open-source systems, including Pisces, SDX, and NetFPGA-10G,
that are widely used in industry and academia. He received the
Facebook Research Award, ACM SOSR Systems Award, APNet Best Paper
Award, Internet2 Innovation Award, and Outstanding Graduate Teaching
Assistant Award.


**Akshitha Sriraman**  
Visiting Researcher, Google.  
Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University (2022)

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/sriraman.jpg" alt="Akshitha Sriraman's Potrait"/> 
Akshitha Sriraman is a Visiting Researcher at Google in the Systems
Research Group. She will start as an Assistant Professor in Electrical
and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in
January 2022. Her research bridges computer architecture and software
systems, demonstrating the importance of that bridge in realizing
efficient hyperscale web services via solutions that span the systems
stack. Her systems solutions to improve hardware efficiency have
improved the performance of hyperscale web systems that serve billions
of users, saving millions of dollars and meaningfully reducing the
global carbon footprint. Additionally, her hardware design proposals
have influenced Intel's Alder Lake+ CPU architectures.

Sriraman's research has been recognized with an IEEE Micro Top Picks
distinction. She was awarded a Facebook Fellowship, a Rackham Merit
Ph.D. Fellowship, and a CIS Full-Tuition Scholarship. Sriraman
completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of Michigan. Over the past few years, she has been involved
in a variety of mentorship initiatives such as the WICARCH mentorship
program, YArch workshop, and JOBS workshop.

## Session 2
**Talia Ringer**  
Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/ringer.jpeg" alt="Talia Ringer's Potrait"/> 
Talia Ringer is an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, where she builds technologies that make it easier
to develop and maintain verified systems. She finished her PhD from
the University of Washington in June 2021, and spent three years in
industry at Amazon before graduate school. She is founder and chair of
the SIGPLAN Long-Term Mentoring Program (SIGPLAN-M), which serves
hundreds of mentees across dozens of countries. She has ten years of
mentoring experience, and continues to mentor through SIGPLAN-M.

**Adrian Sampson**  
Assistant Professor, Cornell University

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/sampson.png" alt="Adrian Sampson's Potrait"/> 
Adrian Sampson is an assistant professor in the computer science
department at Cornell. He works on programming languages, computer
architecture, and the abstractions that separate them. He previously
worked on approximate computing, the idea that we should allow
machines to expose errors to some kinds of applications as a trade-off
for computational efficiency. He sees approximate computing as an
instance of a broader breakdown of airtight distinctions between
hardware and software concerns. Adrian co-chaired the Programming
Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at PLDI 2020 and was a founding
member of the operations team for SIGPLAN’s new long-term mentoring
program (SIGPLAN-M). He moderated the “Demystifying Grad School” panel
at the Young Architect Workshop (YArch) this year and has served on
YArch’s program committee three times.


**Gururaj Saileshwar**  
Graduating Ph.D. Student, Georgia Tech

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/saileshwar.jpg" alt="Gururaj Saileshwar's Potrait"/> 
Gururaj Saileshwar is a graduating Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech,
Atlanta, USA, advised by Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi. His research is at
the intersection of computer architecture and security, including
topics like cache side-channels, transient execution attacks, memory
integrity, and memory safety. Recently, Gururaj has helped co-organize
Meet-A-Senior-Architect and Meet-A-Senior-Student with Joel Emer and
CASA at several computer architecture conferences. He is also a part
of the organizing committee for CALM which is initiating a long-term
mentoring program in computer architecture.



**Mengjia Yan**  
Assistant Professor, MIT

# Moderators

**Sihang Liu**  
Graduating Ph.D. Student, University of Virginia

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/liu.png" alt="Sihang Liu's Potrait"/> 
Sihang Liu is a final-year Ph.D. student at the University of
Virginia, working with Prof. Samira Khan. His research interest lies
in computer systems and architecture. In particular, he is interested
in software-hardware co-design for persistent memory, to make
persistent memory systems, robust, efficient, and secured. He is also
broadly interested in other new and emerging systems, such as
near-data processing and in-network processing.

His research has been recognized as MICRO Top Picks Honorable Mention,
and he is awarded the Google Fellowship. He has broadly participated
in mentoring, from research mentoring for high school, undergraduate,
and master’s students, and non-technical mentorship, including
fellowship application, job hunting, and graduate school
application. Currently, he is the co-chair of this computer
architecture long-term mentorship (CALM) program.
