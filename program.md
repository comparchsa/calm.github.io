## Program

### CALM Kick-Off

To learn more about long term mentoring and the CALM Pilot Program please join
us (virtually) at the CALM Kick-Off Event during MICRO.  The event will feature
panelists from industry and academia discussing their views on mentoring and what
makes a successful mentoring relationship.  The CALM Committee will also take
questions about the program, so please submit any questions here.

To accommodate more time zones, the event will have two sessions:
